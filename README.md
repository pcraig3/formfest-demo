## About

Apply.AI is a demonstration of an AI assistant who checks if you are registered to vote in Ontario.

The demo is meant to serve as an _illustrative example_ of an intelligent assistant that builds a profile of the user over time and can therefore anticipate the data to be input when it sees appropriate form fields.

I have left in my name in the data.json file but you can sub it out for your own and try it out. Note that it gets stopped in its tracks by captchas, so you have to click through that part manually.

The demo uses [playwright](https://playwright.dev) to script form-filling and pings the [OpenAI API](https://platform.openai.com/docs/overview) for input validation.
